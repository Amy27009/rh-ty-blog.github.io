## Welcome To My Blog!
Hi! My name is Ramim and this is my blog on my work experience at RedHat for 1 week.

I was greeted at the waiting area on the ground floor by my teacher Mr. McLoughlin. He is the person that will be taking care of most of the work experience this week. We were brought up to the 5th floor which is where the RedHat office is. We got introductions from Mark and Cathal about who they are and what RedHat is. We did some team-building to get to know everyone else in the office from different schools. We had to guess the celebrity on the back of our backs by asking someone we don't know. After that, Kevin and Anamiha came in to talk about what they do and what they're working on. We then went outside for lunch early because the weather was amazing. When we came back in, Artem talked about the Agile system. It's where systems can be done and altered quicker than the waterfall method. We then implemented it in groups by making a certain version of Mr. Potato for the customer by using the Agile method. After that, Ivan talked about what he does in sales and his journey to RedHat. We went home early at 3:30.

On Tuesday, we got a presentation from Kacper about Bash and Terminal. We played around with a few different commands. Mark challenged everyone at the start to break their laptop and Daniel did today. He crashed his laptop using some random commands on Terminal. We then started working on our blogs on Github. We learned how to fork a repository and make edits on our blogs on Github. Then we learned how to command changes on Terminal for Github. We went for lunch and continued on our blogs when we came back. Near the end of the day, Donal came in to talk to us about his journey to RedHat.

On Wednesday, we started off the day by seeing Mark's emails and what's going on in the company. There's a big dispute with Trump's tariffs and new law changes. After that, we finished up on the Github commands. After a while, we were given a task to make rollercoasters with paper straws, sellotape, skewers, rubber bands and tinfoil that a ball can go through comfortably. It was in teams of 4. At the end, our group got the most loops to work with 1 and a half. We went out for lunch at 1:15 and came back at 2. We then made powerpoints in our groups about rain gardens. That took us up to 3:30 where we presented them and then finished up for the day.
