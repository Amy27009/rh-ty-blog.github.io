## Welcome to Jemimas Blog!
Hello, MY name is Jemima Thompson and i attend Sutton Park School. I am doing one week of work experience with Red Hat and i am learning all about the ins and outs of the company.i am learning about things such as the plenty of different job positions that are available such as the actual software engineers to the consultants who work more with the customers. im learning about red hats achievements and its aims for the future. we are doing hands on activities to teach us new skills that are used here in the company, getting talks from workers about the finer details of their jobs and the steps they took to get to the position they are today and also learning the basics of using a compute. We have been learning different tools such as Git, Agile and Terminal.

## My first day:Monday

Monday was my first day day at Red Hat work experience. We started the day with an introduction to red hat- what they do as a company, there aims, how they make money and the different jobs in the company. we were given this talk by Mark Mcloughlin who has been working with red hat for over 20  years now. He talked to us about how much he believes in the company and we heard about how the positive environment created here drives workers. We heard from Artem who talked to us about Agile, agile is a method that is used to efficiently get work done. Cathal played a game with us to impliment the teachings of agile. We were split into teams of three and had to complete a series of tasks when building a potato head. This taught me about the importance of team work and completing tasks efficiently but also being open and responsive to changes in the plan.

Kevin and Anamiha talked to us about their time at red hat. They talked to us about how they got where they are today and their interests. i really enjoyed hearing Kevins story about when he was in 4th year he saw a problem ( dyslexia books and the lach of representation) and used his coding skills to create a app that helps to solve this problem. I think its really inspirational and shows that no matter your age you can learn coding skills and recognise problems that are around you. 

Ivan Jennings talked to us about his role in Red hat after. I enjpyed this talk alot because i had thought that Red Hat was primarily Software Engineers but this talk opened up my eyes to the flip-side of this, actually selling the product. What Ivan does is he meets potential customers and explains what Red Hat can do to help them with their problems. I find his position very intersting and appealing to my interests because he works in the feild with customers actually 'selling the dream'.


I found monday very fun and very very informative. I have found i really like the atmosphere and working environment at Red Hat and i feel that the people working here genuinly love and care about their jobs.p

##My Second day: Tuesday

MY tuesday was really good. We had a talk in the mornings from one of the consultants (Jamie) who again taught us about the more interactive jobs in the business. He meets clients AFTER theyve decided to work with Red Hat and sort of teaches and simplifies the steps forward is going to work, he said that he spends the first few weeks of the deal in contact with the client but usually he hopes he doesnt hear from the often after that much. i found this talk enjoyable, learning about yet another job at Red Hat that is more of a feild position.

We had a talk from an intern Kasper about different problems that can occur in AI and software and about how important it is to keep the software up to date to avoid hackers and vulnerabilities in the systems. We also learn some of the basics of using Bash. This was eye opening to the rapid pace that technology improves and gave me a good idea of how actually difficult it is for software companies to keep up to date with the changes.

We learnt from Mark about how to use GITHUB. We learnt how to write a blog, how to use github such as pull requests, commiting etc. I actualy enjoyed this talk alot learning about the different languages that tech people use and also how they work efficiently in a collaborative space. 
We also touched on learning how to link Terminal and GIt hub, we learnt that we can make changes on GIt hub through the terminal by using simple code. We learnt all about the different languages and th eway that local servers and websites work. We learnt from a diagram about how you need to downlaod the server, edit on your local computer and send it back out to the website. Its quite hard to explain and to demonstrate but i thought Mark made it relatively simple.

At the end of the day we heard from         about his journey of becoming an architect in red hat.He told us a fascinating story of his journey through deciding what he wants to do with his life. He completed many college courses before realising his love for IT when he was teaching in Liverpool. i though that this talk was really eye opening to the pressures that we can be put under to decide what we want to do with our lives form such an early age but realistacilly we can tinker around and try out lots of different hobbie , jobs and thing before we find omstehing that we truly have a love for. He works in sales but in the more technical side of it which i find very appealing because it is sort of a nice balance of both. I thought he was a really good speaker and it was inspiring. 

## Wednesday


---
on wednesday we had a teambuilding day
for the first few hours before lunch we completed a major team building task. THe people were sorted into teams of 3/4. In my group was two girls and two boys. Are task was to build a functioning rollercoaster with two loops. REflecting on the task my team didnt plan enough at the strat by using agile. We just jumped right in with all of our individual ideas and didnt come together at the beginning. From this task i learned the imporatance of working together and using Agile.  

After lunch we were split into teams and we were to complete a powerpoint on Raingardens. I had a new group. We implemented AGile from the beginning by planning what the themes were going to be and also assigned each person to a smaller subtopic. I felt by usuing Agile we got all of our work done quickly and efficiently. We then had to present our powerpoint to the class and learned some usueful tips and trics from mark and cathal. We learnt about the importance of public speaking in every job.

i felt that wednesday was alot of fun and wuite different to th eother days. I felt the team building excersises were fun but also had a really good underlying lesson abou the importance of Agile that i felt is going to help me in the future for future tasks!! I really enjoyed wednesday
