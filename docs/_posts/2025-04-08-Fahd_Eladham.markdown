* After arriving to RedHat, Marc and Cothal had a chat woith us and explained what RedHat is.
* Afterwords, we did an icebreaker activity to get to know everone where we had the names of celebreties on our backs and had to guess who they were by asking three questions to each person. 
* After that we learned about AGILE from Artem and used potato heads as a demonstration on how to use AGILE. 
* Near the end of the day, we got set up on the laptops and got to do whatever we wanted on them for the last bit. 

We got to leave early on monday so that was very nice.
