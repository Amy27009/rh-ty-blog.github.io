## Welcome To Sean's Blog!

* This week I was in work experience in Red Hat Software engineering company.
* This blog is going to take you through everything we do during the week.
* Work Hours: Each day, we start at 10 AM and finish at 5 PM, giving us a full day of learning and hands-on experience.
* Location: We’re based in the historic Old Central Bank building, which provides a unique and inspiring workspace.
* Learning the Basics: Throughout the week, we’re diving into the fundamentals of coding, which is a great foundation for understanding the tech world.
* Engaging with Experts: We’re also getting talks from different people at Red Hat and participating in various group activities that help us learn more about the company and its culture.








## Monday

On Monday morning, I came in the doors and we gathered in the reception. We were then shown to our desks and had to sign into our laptops. So, while we waited for everything to get working, Mark and Cathal gave us a quick intro about the office and what we’d be working on. 
Then we did this icebreaker game where they stuck the name of a celebrity on our back, and we had to go around asking questions to figure out who we were. The celebrity on my back was Chloe Kardashian which was a difficult one to guess. 

Later, after lunch in spar we went back to the room and Artem talked to us about agile. They explained it by giving us Mr. Potato Heads and a theme to design them around. We had to assign one person in our team as the owner, one person as the builder and one person designated to go and collected the parts, once at a time. 

Overall, day one was basically just fun and games, but tomorrow we’re diving into blogs and learning about Fedora and terminals.

## Tuesday

Tuesday morning Mark went through the company emails with us, and showed us the emails and the debates on the memo list.

Tuesday kicked off with an informative introduction to Bash. We had a presentation that covered the fundamentals—what Bash is, why it's useful, and how it's used in real-world development. The presenter also showed us his own terminal setup on his laptop, which helped us understand how developers interact with the command line in a practical setting.

Later in the morning, we worked with Mark to start learning GitHub. He guided us through the process of forking a sample repository, editing our blogs directly in the code, committing the changes, and then creating a pull request to submit our updates. It was a hands-on way to learn version control, and it felt great to get a glimpse into collaborative development workflows.

For lunch, we went to Sprouts, which was a lovely break. I had the Tokyo Salad Bowl and sat with Ramim, Daniel, and Jemima. The food was great, and it was nice to relax and chat with everyone outside the work environment.

After lunch, we focused on finishing our blogs and making sure everything was properly committed and submitted. To wrap up the day, we had a really inspiring talk from Donal Spring. He shared his personal journey to working at Red Hat, including how he went back to university later in life and switched careers around 5 or 6 times. His main message stood out to all of us: *the decisions you make now don’t define your entire future*. It was a reassuring reminder that career paths can be flexible, and that it's okay to explore and change directions.
